Description of the programs:

The NoParallel_Ising program runs the Metropolis algorithm without parallelization. 
The Parallel_Ising program does the same but with parallelization.
The AcceptedConfigurationsperCycle program gives: energy and its variance, magnetization and number of accepted configuration per MC cycle.
The TotalAcceptedConfigurations program gives final values and total number of accepted configuration for the total number of MC cycles.
