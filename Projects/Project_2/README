The Benchmark folder contains a couple of selected results files obtained for the three cases studied in this project. 
Inside the Programs folder you will find another folder called "UnitTests", which contains the Jacobi algorithm alongside
some test functions and a program that automatically creates a main function to run those tests. Outside that folder, you 
will find the Jacobi algorithm alongside a custom main function and the armadillo-algorithm program.
